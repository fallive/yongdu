  <h1>Research interest</h1>
  <p>
    <li> Dark Matter: I am very interested in dark matter at different mass scales and its detection through direct and indirect detection as well as its searches at colliders.</li>
    <li> Neutrino properties: I am also very interested neutrino physics. </li>
    <li> Collider physics: I am also very interested collider physics. </li>
    <li> Multi-loop electroweak radiative corrections: I am also very interested loop calculations.</li>

  <h1>Research Experience</h1>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Collider related projects:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We studied in detail the decay patterns of all BSM Higgs particles in the complex Higgs triplet model, as well as their production cross sections at the 100TeV future circular collider, the promising discovery channels of the model and the channels that are related to model parameters involved in baryogenesis. Our result will appear on arXiv shortly.

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Electroweak precision test related projects in and beyond the standard model:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Two-loop contributions to the atomic parity vialotion (APV) of Moller scattering at the future 12GeV Jefferson Lab: At the upgraded Jefferson Lab, experimentalists will be able to measure the APV of Moller scattering as precisely as 33 ppb with an overall precision of about 0.7ppb. The precision of the future experimental result will require theoreists to do a full two-loop calculation within the standard model in order to ensure the existence of sources of new physics. We have currently finished the 1-loop contribution to the APV in the standard model and are at the beginning of the full two-loop calculation. We shall finish the fermion contribution to APV before 2017 Summer.</li>
        <li>Two-loop corrections to muon anomalous magnetic moment (AMM) in 2HDM: 2HDM is one of the most popular beyond standard models, we studied its two-loop corrections to the muon AMM in a general non-linear R<sub>&xi;</sub> gauge. We calculated most of the Barr-Zee type diagrams and some of the non Barr-Zee type diagrams, but we got scooped by Victor Ilisie in Spain in 2015, who did the calculation in Feynman gauge.</li>
